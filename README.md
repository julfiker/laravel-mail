## Send a email and logs system based on Laravel with SOA
ITs a SOA, or service-oriented architecture, defines a way to make software components reusable and interoperable via service interfaces. Services use common interface standards and an architectural pattern so you can be rapidly incorporated into new applications.   

This interface is a service contract between the service provider and service consumer. Applications behind the service interface written in the framework like others in Java, Microsoft .Net others programming language, supplied as packaged software applications by a vendor (e.g., SAP), SaaS applications (e.g., Salesforce CRM), or obtained as open source applications.  Service interfaces are frequently defined using Web Service Definition Language (WSDL) which is a standard tag structure based on xml (extensible markup language).   

My objective to use laravel framework in a best way like other programming languages Java spring-boot and .net. So that we can get benefited to make a project or service with following benefits  
--Greater business agility; faster time to market   
--Ability to leverage legacy functionality in new markets   
--Improved collaboration between business and IT
